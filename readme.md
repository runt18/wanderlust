## Intro

Wanderlust is a website that gives you inspiration for new places to visit on holiday.

## Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lavelle/wanderlust
cd somewhere
make install
```

## Building

To build the webapp, run `make site`. To build the Chrome extension, run `make chrome`.

## Installing

To access the webapp locally, run `make serve &` to start a new server in the background. You can then access it at `http://localhost:1234/`. Make sure to run `make site` before this.

To install the extension, navigate to `chrome://extension`, click 'Load unpacked extension', then browse to and select the `extension` directory.

## Structure

### Source files

- `extension`: Files specific to the Chrome extension. Any assets shared between this and the webapp will be copied in on build.
- `image`: Rendered images such as PNGs and JPGs.
- `image_project`: Photoshop and Illustrator project files.
- `js`: Shared JavaScript code for the webapp and extension.
- `stylus`: [Stylus][] stylesheets to be compiled to CSS.

### Build files

These directories are not checked into source control, but are generated by the build tools.

- `node_modules`: npm modules needed for building.
- `vendor`: Third-party libraries installed by Bower.
- `site`: The generated code for the webapp.
